# Plant Growth Predictor

An end-to-end web application that predicts plant growth milestones based on user input including sunlight, water frequency, fertilizer type, temperature, and humidity. Built using **FastAPI** for the backend and **React** for the frontend. Dockerized for easy deployment.

---

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* Node.js & npm
* Git

---

## Overview

This repository contains the source code and Docker configuration for the Plant Growth Predictor application. It exposes a REST API for predictions and a web UI to interact with the model.

---

## Getting Started with Docker Hub

You can quickly get started by pulling the pre-built Docker image from Docker Hub and running it locally.

### Prerequisites

* Docker installed (Engine and CLI)

### Pulling the Image

```bash
docker pull bouachrineyassine/plant-growth-predictor:backend
docker pull bouachrineyassine/plant-growth-predictor:frontend
```

## Running Backend and Frontend Containers Separately

You can also run the backend and frontend as separate containers on a custom Docker network:

```bash
# Create the network (if not already created)
docker network create plant-network

# Run the backend
docker run -d \
  --name plant-growth-backend \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  --network plant-network \
  bouachrineyassine/plant-growth-predictor:backend

# Run the frontend
docker run -d \
  --name plant-growth-frontend \
  -p 3000:80 \
  --network plant-network \
  -e REACT_APP_API_URL=http://plant-growth-backend:8000/api \
  bouachrineyassine/plant-growth-predictor:frontend
```

---

## Local Development

If you want to run the application from source for development:

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yassinebouachrine/plant-growth-predictor.git
cd plant-growth-predictor
```

### Backend Setup (FastAPI)

1. Navigate to the backend folder:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
   .\env\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   ```

3. Install Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start the FastAPI server:

   ```bash
   uvicorn app:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

### Frontend Setup (React)

1. In another terminal, navigate to the frontend folder:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install Node.js dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
